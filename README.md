## About KeskOS

`KeskOS` is a full live operating system built on Arch Linux. It boots straight into a usable KDE Plasma desktop, carries its own visual identity from boot to login to installer to desktop, and installs through a custom-themed Calamares workflow.

It is meant to feel like a complete product instead of a loose rice script:

- a real live ISO you can boot and test before installing
- a dark industrial orange-on-black desktop style
- a patched `Kesk Kickoff` launcher integrated into Plasma
- a branded KeskOS default bottom panel with launcher, pinned apps, and workspace switching
- a themed terminal, browser home page, login stack, lock screen, splash screen, and installer
- a custom window decoration theme built for the rest of the OS look
- a desktop that stays visually consistent across the live session and installed system

Project planning and active work are tracked in:

- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)
- [docs/repository-structure.md](docs/repository-structure.md)
- [docs/launcher-switching.md](docs/launcher-switching.md)
- [docs/plasma-panel-layout.md](docs/plasma-panel-layout.md)
- [docs/keybinds.md](docs/keybinds.md)

## Main Features

- KDE Plasma
- autologin into the live environment
- working launcher, browser, terminal, and file manager

### Desktop Experience

The installed system carries over the visual identity:

- custom orange console look

- branded bottom panel with launcher, pinned apps, and workspace switcher

- browser selection during install
- prefilled username on the first login screen after install
